# Release 2024_027 (unreleased)

## Impact

- nothing yet

## NixOS 24.05 platform

- Fix an issue with low network performance by pinning the kernel to version
  5.15.164. The faulty kernel (5.15.165) introduced in release 2024_026 had
  not yet reached production machines when we rolled out the change on
  2024-09-03. This hotfix was merged with the regular maintenance updates and
  caused no additional impact (PL-132971).
