Firewall
========

Service users are allowed to add custom firewall rules. To do so place
configuration files containing iptables rules in the directory :file:`local` at
:file:`/var/lib/iptables/rules.d/filter` or
:file:`/var/lib/ip6tables/rules.d/filter` according the appropriate iptables
chain. The filenames have to start with at least two digits and are joined
together by ascending numbers.

For example, to add a ruleset for outgoing IPv6 connections, place a
configuration file at
:file:`/var/lib/ip6tables/rules.d/filter/OUTPUT/local/60custom`

Altered configuration files are activated on a regular basis by a cron job every
10 minutes. Alternatively, service users (or those with `sudo-srv` permissions)
can trigger an update run manually::

   sudo localconfig
