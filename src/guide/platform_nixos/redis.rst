Redis
=====

Runs a `Redis <http://redis.io>`_ database server. The server listens on the
*srv* interface on port 6379.

Components
----------

* Redis

Configuration
-------------

The Redis configuration is fully managed. Currently there are no adaptable
options.

The authentication password is automatically generated upon installation
and can be read *and changed* by service users. It can be found in
:file:`/etc/local/redis/password`.


Interaction
-----------

Service users may invoke :command:`sudo fc-manage --build` to apply
service configuration changes and trigger service restarts (if necessary).

Monitoring
----------

The default monitoring setup checks that the Redis server is running, and is responding to `PING <https://redis.io/commands/ping>`_.
