"We use a redundant routed layer 3 network as the basis of production "

"On top of this routed network we use an overlay technology called EVPN-"

"**SRV** - Server to server communication. Used for customer application "
"components to talk to each other, e.g. database traffic and for "

"from the internet at our DC edge firewalls and allows only HTTP/S and SSH"
" traffic. Additionally VMs can filter this traffic locally and only allow"
" arbitrary traffic from VMs belonging to the same project by default. "
