Release 2017_026 (2017-11-02)
-----------------------------

Impact
^^^^^^

* [NixOS] RabbitMQ instances will be restarted.
* [NixOS] nginx will be restarted.


NixOS platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Always restart Telegraf after a crash. This will result in less
  noise in monitoring and alerting (#28876).
* Always restart Kibana after a crash (#28795).
* Monitor %steal CPU value to ensure we do not miss completely overloaded hosts
  (#28296).
* Basic role for RabbitMQ (#28707).
* Security update for RabbitMQ (#28725).
* Ignore freshclam's exit status so that the systemd check doesn't alert
  (#28236).
* The uptime check was never alerting. Fix it with hopefully reasonable settings
  for automated alerting and human awareness (#28837).
* Update wkhtmltopdf to 0.12.4 (#28838).
* Update nginx to 0.10.3 (#28890).


Gentoo platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Improve outside connectivity check (#28798).
* Improve firewall rules (#28288).
* Silence `runscript` warnings (#28401).
