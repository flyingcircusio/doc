Elasticsearch
=============

Managed instance of `Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>`_ 2.4.


Configuration
-------------

Upon activating the role, Elasticsearch forms a cluster named as the VM's name. To change the cluster name, add a file :file:`/etc/local/elasticsearch/clusterName`, with the cluster name as its sole contents. To activate run :command:`sudo fc-manage --build` (see :ref:`nixos-local` for details).

Elasticsearch instances are configured with a reasonable memory configuration, depending on the VMs configured memory.

Monitoring
----------

The following checks are active initially:

* Circuit Breakers active

* Cluster Health

* File descriptors in use

* Heap too full

* Node status

* Shard allocation status
