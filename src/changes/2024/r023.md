# Release 2024_023 (2024-07-29)

## NixOS 24.05 platform

- opensearch: `opensearch-readme` and `opensearch-show-config` scripts now function correctly but don't use the (broken) pager anymore (PL-132830).
- non-prod/staging VMs now run system updates in announced maintenance windows, like production machines. Before, updates on non-production machines were applied almost immediately, with possible service interruptions throughout the day. Also, non-prod used a different code path which doesn't run maintenance enter and exit commands which are important to maintain redundancy for distributed systems like opensearch, slurm and k3s, for example (PL-132792).
- slurm: is usable now and works as before on 23.11, with the only difference that `SelectType` is now `cons_tres`. This is the slurm default and can be overridden as needed in custom config (PL-132833).
- gitlab: 17.1.1 -> 17.1.3 (PL-132857).
- Production channel URL for this release: https://hydra.flyingcircus.io/build/465081/download/1/nixexprs.tar.xz
