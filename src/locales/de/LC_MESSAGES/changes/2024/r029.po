"This platform release includes a very new Linux kernel release (6.11) "
"that gets activated in our DEV and WHQ locations as well as on all non-"
"production VMs. Selected production VMs will be updated as well . "
"However, customers affected by this on a production VM will be notified "
"individually with an in-depth briefing. This Linux release includes a fix"
" for a bug that has been stopping us from updating past the 5.15 LTS "
"branch since last year â€“ but 5.15 is considered ancient by now. The "
"upstream developers are confident that this release fixes the bug and "
"will provide a backport to an LTS release at a later point. However, due "
"to the shy nature of the bug our part in fixing it is to help gather "
"evidence that this bug does not reappear. We expect to be running this "
"for at least 4-8 weeks for valid evidence (PL-132972)."
