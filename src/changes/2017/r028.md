## Release notes

We've seen some old virtualenvs breaking after the Python update. If an Python
application does not start anymore with an error message like:

```
NameError: name 'PROTOCOL_TLS' is not defined
```

try recreating the virtualenv or contact our [support].

Some applications might be affected by the glibc update on Gentoo. This may lead
to strange encoding/locale/collation errors. Usually it is sufficient to restart
the affected service.
