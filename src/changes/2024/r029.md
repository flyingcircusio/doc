# Release 2024_029 (unreleased)

## Impact

- nothing yet

## NixOS 24.05 platform

- postgresql: the script for verifying/updating collation versions on service
  start now works correctly with special database names that need "quoting"
  in SQL statements (PL-133030).
- webproxy: The `default.vcl` configuration mechanism for varnish is here to
  stay. We decided to un-deprecate this as it is useful and we will be
  integrating it with the newer mechanism in the near future (PL-132174).
- This platform release includes a very new Linux kernel release (6.11) that
  gets activated in our DEV and WHQ locations as well as on all
  non-production VMs. Selected production VMs will be updated as well .
  However, customers affected by this on a production VM will be notified
  individually with an in-depth briefing. This Linux release includes a fix
  for a bug that has been stopping us from updating past the 5.15 LTS branch
  since last year â€“ but 5.15 is considered ancient by now. The upstream
  developers are confident that this release fixes the bug and will provide a
  backport to an LTS release at a later point. However, due to the shy nature
  of the bug our part in fixing it is to help gather evidence that this bug
  does not reappear. We expect to be running this for at least 4-8 weeks for
  valid evidence (PL-132972).
