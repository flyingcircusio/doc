# Release 2025_013 (2025-05-05)

## Impact

### 24.11

- Reboot due to updated kernels.


## NixOS 24.05 platform

- Activate configuration changes in an (immediate) boot cycle when upgrading (or downgrading)
  the NixOS major release. (PL-133570)

  We've experienced too many paper cuts, trying to get pure "online upgrades" working reliably
  in our fleet. Many edge cases like systemd upgrades, NFS connections, have shown that this
  isn't possible in the general case.

  As NixOS major releases ship with different kernel versions anyway and thus always scheduled
  to perform an immediate reboot in maintenance, we no defer the whole config update into
  that reboot.

  If a config change is applied manually and causes a major version change, the reboot will
  be applied immediately - after warning the user visually and giving a 10 second countdown
  in case of the user wanting to abort.
