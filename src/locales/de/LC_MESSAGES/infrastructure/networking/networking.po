"We use a redundant routed layer 3 network as the basis of production "

msgid ""
"**MGM** - Management, purely for administrative purposes. This network "

" world, private IPv4 address space."

#: ../../../src/infrastructure/networking/networking.md:61
msgid ""
"**FE** - Frontend, for customer application traffic. This network "
"connects to managed machines that provide customers' application to the "
"public. This network is switched to the VM and leverages completely "
"public traffic. The DC firewalls do not filter this, however the default "
"system firewall running locally on managed VMs blocks inbound "
"connections. Customer applications are free to use any ports they like. "
"These ports must be listed in the firewall configuration in order to "
"receive inbound connections. All managed VMs receive a NIC on this "
"network but not necessarily IPv4 or IPv6 addresses if they do not provide"
" public services. DNS example: *vm00.fe.rzob.fcio.net*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/infrastructure/networking/networking.md:71
msgid ""
"**SRV** - Server to server communication. Used for customer application "
"components running in managed VMs to talk to each other, e.g. database "
"traffic and for management purposes on the application level. This "
"network is firewalled from the internet at our DC edge firewalls and "
"allows only HTTP(S) and SSH traffic. Additionally, managed VMs can filter"
" this traffic locally, and only allow arbitrary traffic from VMs "
"belonging to the same project by default. This network is used on all "
"managed VMs and has IPv4 (usually private) and IPv6 addresses allocated "
"automatically. DNS example: *vm00.srv.rzob.fcio.net* or simply "
"*vm00.fcio.net*."
msgstr ""

"**PUB** - Public, for traffic to unmanaged VMs. Unmanaged VMs which are "
"not running our managed platform receive a NIC on this network and public"
" IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in order to provide general access to and from "
"the internet. This network uses a layer 3 transport, and is not "
"firewalled. Unmanaged VMs do not come with a preconfigured local firewall"

"themselves. DNS example: *vm00.pub.rzob.fcio.net*"

"*filer.sto.rzob.gocept.net*."
