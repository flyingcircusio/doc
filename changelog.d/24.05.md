## Impact
### 24.05

- There is a small but non-zero potential that some clients may experience connectivity issues with nginx.
  Multiple connectivity testing tools showed no change for clients and/or libraries but cannot cover every single implementation out there.

- services using an updated package will be restarted

- Activate DDoS SSH rules in fail2ban for production machines.

## NixOS 24.05 platform

- agent: fix merging cold boot activities into warm reboots. We noticed maintenance requests that have been postponed multiple times on some machines, causing repeated maintenance notification mails. (PL-133180).

- Increase SSL validation check timeout to better distinguish DNS resolution
  errors and other causes of timeouts. (PL-133125)

- Restrict a class of key agreement protocols, called Diffie-Hellman Elliptic Curves, enabled in Nginx to mitigate a DoS attack vector
  described in CVE-2024-41996. The curves for ECDHE ciphers are then restricted to x25519, secp256r1, and x448.

- Update the mailserver role documentation with an example nix configuration

- Fix permissions for some platform logic that creates a `.erlang.cookie` for rabbitmq which would previously cause a failure when starting the service.
  The problem was caused due to insufficient write permissions when attempting to write the cookie after rabbitmq's first startup.
  During first startup, rabbimq generates a random cookie, writes it to the appropriate file and sets that file to be read-only.

- Pull upstream NixOS changes, security fixes and package updates (PL-133203):

- Scheduled rotation of CS' root ssh key

- Activate DDoS SSH rules in fail2ban for all machines as protection against SSH DHeat attacks. (PL-132477)
  This may have impact if you have multiple unauthenticated SSH connections in a short time.
  We tested this change on non-production machines over the last 3 weeks and got no reports of problems.
