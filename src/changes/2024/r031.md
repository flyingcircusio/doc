# Release 2024_031 (2024-11-11)

% scriv-insert-here

## Impact

### 24.05

- NFS clients will be rebooted to activate the new configuration. This happens
  as a side effect of a kernel update. In the future changes to NFS client
  settings will cause explicit reboot requests.

- Activate DDoS SSH rules in fail2ban for non-production machines

- Machines will schedule a maintenance reboot to activate the new kernel.

## NixOS 24.05 platform

- Make NFS clients more resilient against missing servers during bootstrap,
  upgrades, and reboot scenarios. (PL-133062)

- Activate DDoS SSH rules in fail2ban for non-production machines. (PL-132477)
  This may have impact if you have multiple unauthenticated SSH connections in a short time.
  We will roll out this change to production VMs too if no problems occur.

- Explain how to use the the new release metadata URLs in DevHosts. (FC-41601)

- varnish: Fix syntax error handling during hot reloads. We silently did
  not fail on errors which masked issues until the next reboot causing
  varnish to then fail e.g. during scheduled maintenance. We now fail
  more visibly but keep running the old config, still. (FC-41403)

- Pull upstream NixOS changes, security fixes and package updates:
    - chromium: 129.0.6668.100 -> 130.0.6723.69 (CVE-2024-10229, CVE-2024-10230, CVE-2024-10231)
    - discourse: 3.2.5 -> 3.3.2
    - docker: 27.3.0 -> 27.3.1
    - element-web: 1.11.81 -> 1.11.82
    - firefox: 131.0.3 -> 132.0
    - github-runner: 2.319.1 -> 2.320.0
    - gitlab: 17.2.8 -> 17.3.6
    - grafana: 10.4.10 -> 10.4.11
    - linux: 5.15.164 -> 5.15.169

    - unifi8: 8.4.62 -> 8.5.6

## NixOS 21.05 platform

```{note}
This is an internal release not available to customer VMs.
As this release powers the Flyingcircus Infrastructure, changes resulting in
customer-facing behaviour are included here nonetheless.
```

- Implement automatic (offline) migration of VM disks between different pools
  (SSD <-> HDD). (PL-131857)

- Switch our central DNS recursive resolvers to prefer the default Quad9
  servers to alleviate reliability issues. We used to prefer the Quad9
  servers with improved geolocation capabilities, but experienced subtle
  DNS issues while using them and were advised by Quad9 to switch to the
  default servers. (PL-133125)

- Improve central DNS recursive resolver debugging capabilities. (PL-133125)
