# Hardware specifications

All hardware we procure for our infrastructure will comply to the following
specifications. Older hardware may have been bought adhering to former
versions of the specification and will be upgraded over time and as necessary.

Housing customers' equipment also needs to comply to the specification valid
at the time of installation.

## Servers

All servers, independently of their role, require:

- 1 1G network port onboard with shared IPMI and PXE boot functionality
- 2 25G network ports with VXLAN offloading (Nvidia Connect X-4 or newer)
- Support for UEFI boot
- OS disks: 1 SSD M.2 internal, >= 240 GiB
- CPU-Architecture: x86_64, preferably AMD
- BMC supporting IPMI 2.0 with serial console via LAN on shared port
- Redundant power supply
- Sliding rack rails

Historic requirements, usually always given nowadways:

- Needs to be bootable from USB flash drive
- PCIe bus
