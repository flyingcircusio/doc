.. _api-resource-types:

Resource Types
==============

The API supports various resource types. Some of them can be queried and
updated, others can only be queried.

Each type has a set of identifying keys which correspond to the RDBMS
"primary key" concept. When updating or deleting a record you need to specify
at least the primary key to ensure unambiguity.

Project
~~~~~~~

Projects are the foundational building block for organizing resources
in the Flying Circus platform: they group together which machines belong
to the same project, which users have permissions for them, what rules
apply for maintenance, and more.

.. note:: In technical terms a project is just a thing grouping resource, hence we used to call projects "resource groups". The API still uses the old term, and will continue to do so to ensure compatibility.

In addition to the project that your key is associated with, you
can create new child projects.

The structure of a project record looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

  {'__type__': 'resourcegroup',
   'customer_no': '',
   'maintenance_end': 5,
   'maintenance_start': 22,
   'name': 'services',
   'notification_leadtime': 12,
   'parent': '',
   'production': True,
   'technical_contacts': ['admin@flyingcircus.io'],
   'timezone': 'Europe/Berlin'}]

name
    *read-only, primary key, filterable*

    The name of the project. Needs to be a valid Linux group name.

customer_no
    *readonly, filterable, default: inherited or pre-set*

    The customer number of the customer who is charged for resources
    that belong to this project.

maintenance_start
    *filterable, default:* ``22``

    Hour in the day when scheduled maintenance windows may start.


maintenance_end
    *filterable, default:* ``5``

    Hour in the day when scheduled maintenance windows should end.

notification_leadtime
    *filterable, default:* ``12``

    Number of hours that technical contacts should be informed upfront
    about maintenance windows.

timezone
    *filterable, default:* ``'Europe/Berlin'``

    The name of a timezone that VMs should be running in and that
    any time specifications (like maintenance windows) should be
    relative to.

parent
    *default:* ``''``

    Name of the parent project if this project has one.

    If you create new projects, this will be set to the name
    of the project that your API key belongs to. Alternatively
    you can set the parent to any project that your API key
    has access to.

    (Making new top-level projects does not make much sense as
    they would become inaccessible to your API key anyway.)

production
    *filterable, default:* ``True``

    Indicates whether the services of this project are considered
    for production use (in contrast to testing, staging, dev, or similar
    non-production instances).

technical_contacts
    *default:* ``[]``


    A list of strings specifying email addresses that should be notified
    of technical updates (monitoring, maintenance windows, ...).



Service users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Service users are used to run your actual services - compared to running them
in your login user.  This gives additional security and allows more flexible
workflows when cooperating with other team members.

In nested projects, service users exist on all child projects
recursively.

You can query, create, update and delete service users. Their names always
start with ``s-`` to make them distinguishable from regular users. Their names
are unique per project, so you can have multiple services users named
``s-myservice`` in different projects.

The structure of a service user record looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    {'__type__': 'serviceuser',
     'description': '',
     'gid_number': 101,
     'home_directory': '/srv/s-services',
     'id_number': 1000,
     'login_shell': '/bin/bash',
     'resource_group': 'services',
     'resource_groups_recursive': ['services'],
     'ssh_pubkey': [],
     'uid': 's-services',
     'virtual_machines': []}

uid
    *read-only, primary key, filterable*

    The Linux name of this service user. Needs to start with ``s-`` and
    be unique within each project.

resource_group
    *read-only, primary key*

    The name of the resourcegroup this service user belongs to.

resource_groups_recursive
    *read-only*

    The flattened list of names of all projects that this
    service user has access to.

description
    *default:* ``''``

    A descriptive text that will be displayed in the context of this service
    user to clarify its purpose.

id_number
    *read-only*

    The numerical id that this user has on Linux machines.

gid_number
    *read-only, default:* ``101``

    The numerical id of the primary group that this user wears on Linux
    machines.

home_directory
    *read-only, default:* ``'/srv/<uid>'``

    The home directory that this user has on Linux machines. Historical users
    may deviate from that schema. The record is kept to avoid unnecessarily
    moving data around.

login_shell
    *read-only, default:* ``'/bin/bash'``

    The service user may have a deviating login shell in special circumstances.
    Normally it's just bash.

ssh_pubkey
    *read-only, default:* ``[]``

    The service user can be permitted to log in via SSH (although we do
    not recommend this normally). To set a service users's SSH keys, please
    use the `self-service UI <https://my.flyingcircus.io>`_.

virtual_machines
    *read-only*

    The names of all the virtual machines that this service user has
    access to.


User permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Permissions are assigned to users (human and service) on a per-project
basis and control the access level that users have to login and interact with
virtual machines and other services.

The available permissions are:

`login`
    Grants the user the ability to log into virtual machines by SSH.
    Does not allow the user to configure or control services on the machines.

`sudo-srv`
    Grants the user the ability to configure and control services on
    the machines by sudoing into service user accounts after logging
    in via SSH.

`stats`
    Grants the user (read-only) access to statistical backend services like
    Nagios, PNP, Kibana, awstats and others.

Permission records look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    {'__type__': 'permission',
     'permission': 'test',
     'resource_group': 'services',
     'uid': 's-services'}


permission
    *read-only, primary key*

    The name of the permission that is granted.

resource_group
    *read-only, primary key*

    The name of the project the permission is granted.
    Applies to child projects as long as the child resource
    group does not define any other permission.

uid
    *read-only, primary key, filterable*

    The uid of the user that this permission applies to. Can apply to
    human and service users.


.. _api-virtual-machines:

Virtual Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API allows querying, creating, updating, and deleting the VM resources
that your services need.

Creation of VMs may take a while: you can be sure that a machine is ready
to use when the ``needs_install`` flag is set to ``False``.

Updates to VM propagate depending on your change. Virtual hardware changes
may take a while to be applied and may even require a maintenance window.

Creation or changes to the VM's resources may be rejected if it would
exceed safety thresholds of our data centers. There are also some limits
given by the API to avoid accidents.

A virtual machine record looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    {'__type__': 'virtualmachine',
     'classes': ['role::generic'],
     'cores': 1,
     'creation_date': '2015-01-02T03:04:05+00:00',
     'deletion': {'deadline': '', 'stages': []},
     'disk': 10,
     'environment': '',
     'id': 4100,
     'interfaces': {'fe': {'mac': '02:00:00:02:10:04', 'networks': {}},
                    'srv': {'mac': '02:00:00:03:10:04',
                            'networks': {'192.168.0.0/24':
                                         ['192.168.0.2']}}},
     'kvm_host': '',
     'last_maintenance_end': '',
     'location': 'rzob',
     'machine': 'virtual',
     'memory': 256,
     'name': 'services10',
     'online': True,
     'production': True,
     'resource_group': 'services',
     'resource_group_parent': '',
     'frontend_ips_v4': 0,
     'frontend_ips_v6': 0,
     'reverses': {},
     'service_description': '',
     'servicing': True,
     'timezone': 'Europe/Berlin'}

name
    *read-only, primary key*

    The name of the virtual machine. All machines within a project
    need to adhere to the schema ``<nameofrg><serialnumber>``. You can choose
    how to allocate those numbers as you like.

    We typically use ``00`` for the frontend machine, the numbers
    ``01`` - ``09`` are typically for singular services like databases,
    mailservers, and other auxiliary things.

    Higher numbers typically indicate clusters of application instances, like
    ``10`` - ``30`` being instances of your application.

resource_group
    *readonly, required*

    The name of the project this VM belongs to.

location
    *readonly, required*

    The data center that this VM is running in. Can only (and must) be set
    to ``'rzob'``, our only public data center at the moment.

id
    *read-only*

    A globally unique integer ID identifying this VM instance.

service_description
    *default:* ``''``

    A textual description of the purpose of this VM. This will be shown
    in appropriate places, e.g. as MOTD when logging in to the VM.

resource_group_parent
    *readonly*

    The name of the parent project of the project this
    VM belongs to.

     'timezone': 'Europe/Berlin'

classes
    *default*: ``['role::generic', 'role::backupclient']``

    Those are names for the "managed components", or "roles" that we provide
    to install on your machine. You can find details about each class
    in the :ref:`managed-components` documentation.

    A few roles are not selectable by you: if your VM runs in a production
    project, it will always be marked as ``role::backupclient`` to
    ensure safety of your data.

    Generally your VM will always have the ``role::generic`` class applied.

    Removing those classes is ignored.

environment_class
    *default*: ``Puppet``

    The ``environment_class`` is the general flavor of your VM. Possible values are:

    * Puppet
    * NixOS.

environment
    *default*: ``production``

    The environment

cores
    *default*: ``1``

    The number of virtual cores assigned to the VM. A maximum of 8 cores
    can be assigned per VM. If you need more:
    `contact us <mailto:support@flyingcircus.io>`_.

    Changing the number of cores will schedule a maintenance window to
    reboot the VM.

memory
    *default*: ``256``

    The amount of memory assigned to the VM in MiB. The minimum of 256 MiB
    can not be undercut. Through the API you can assign a maximum of 3072 MiB
    (or 3 GiB) to a single VM. If you need more:
    `contact us <mailto:support@flyingcircus.io>`_.

    Changing the amount of memory will schedule a maintenance window to
    reboot the VM.

disk
    *default*: ``10``

    The amount of disk space assigned to the root disk (``/``) of your VM
    in GiB. The minimum of 10 GiB can not be undercut. Through the API
    you can assign a maximum of 1000GiB to a virtual machine.

    We provide auxiliary space for ``/tmp`` and ``swap`` for free.

    Increasing the amount of disk space will perform an online resize within
    a few minutes.

    Decreasing the amount of disk space will schedule a maintenance window
    to reboot the VM.

environment
    *readonly, default:*: ``'production'``

    The environment is the rolling-release version of our platform and
    management code. VMs created through the API will always be set
    to `'production'`. In some cases we may adjust the environment for you
    to provide you with early access to features or bugfixes or include
    your staging environment into continuous pre-release testing.

     'online': True,

interfaces
    *readonly*

    A hierarchy of VLANs, the assigned IP networks (4 and 6)
    and the associated IP addresses for the VM.

    ``srv`` indicates the server-to-server communication channel.
    Those machines will only be assigned private IPv4 addresses but
    public IPv6 addresses. ``fe`` indicates public internet traffic.

reverses:
    *readonly*

    A list of IP addresses and registered reverse DNS names. We can set
    those for you if you contact us.


frontend_ips_v4
    *default:* ``0``

    The number of public IPv4 addresses to allocate for this VM. Increasing this
    number will cause more addresses to be allocated. Decreasing this number
    will *not* remove IP addresses at this time. `Contact us
    <mailto:support@flyingcircus.io>`_ if you want to reduce this number.

.. note::

    Public IPv4 addresses are a scarce resource. Most virtual machines
    do not require one. Typically you need only 1 per project,
    maybe 2 or 3 under certain conditions. In the case of excessive use
    we may reduce the number of IPs available to your VM.

    The number of public IPv4 addresses is limited to 3 per machine.

    If you have a special case that justifies using more IPv4 addresses, please
    `talk to us <mailto:support@flyingcircus.io>`_ and we will be happy to work
    on a solution with you.

frontend_ips_v6
    *default:* ``0``

    The number of public IPv6 addresses to allocate for this VM. Increasing this
    number will cause more addresses to be allocated. Decreasing this number
    will *not* remove IP addresses at this time. `Contact us
    <mailto:support@flyingcircus.io>`_ if you want to reduce this number.

    The API limits you to 100 public IPv6 addresses per virtual machine.

machine
    *readonly*

    Indicates that this is a virtual machine. In the future we may provide
    access to physical machines which would have similar records but
    display ``physical`` instead of ``virtual`` in this place.

kvm_host
    *readonly*

    The hostname of the machine running your VM. Given for informative
    purposes. Sometimes having two VMs run on the same host may give
    significantly different networking results.

production
    *readonly*

    Reflects the setting of this VM's ``production`` flag - see above.

servicing
    *readonly, default:* ``True``

    Reflects whether this VM is assumed to be doing purposeful things at the
    moment. During maintenance this may be set to ``False`` and may be used
    by our infrastructure to temporarily do things to this VM that would
    not be appropriate if it was busy.

last_maintenance_end
    *readonly*

    The date and time when the VM was last in maintenance mode,  ISO 6801 formatted with time zone. This can be useful to correlate with monitoring results. For instance you could ignore monitoring errors for a certain time after the maintenance ended to avoid notifications.

creation_date
    Date and time when the VM has been created, ISO 6801 formatted with
    time zone.

deletion
    *readonly, default:* ``{'deadline': '', 'stages': []}``

    Reflects the deletion state of this VM. Reflects the deadline and
    the stages of the deletion that have been reached already.

Here is the full list of all available managed components:

* ``role::antivirus``
* ``role::appserver``
* ``role::backupclient``
* ``role::dbserver``
* ``role::dovecot``
* ``role::gis``
* ``role::golang``
* ``role::jabber``
* ``role::java``
* ``role::lampserver``
* ``role::ldapserver``
* ``role::loghost``
* ``role::mailinglistserver``
* ``role::mailserver``
* ``role::mysql``
* ``role::nfs_rg_client``
* ``role::nfs_rg_share``
* ``role::php``
* ``role::postgresql84``
* ``role::postgresql90``
* ``role::postgresql93``
* ``role::pspdf``
* ``role::rabbitmq``
* ``role::redis``
* ``role::webgateway``
* ``role::webproxy``

Deleting a virtual machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you delete a VM without any options it will be marked for deletion by the
end of the current month. After that it will not be accounted for any longer
and will be shut down, and unconfigured. The data will be deleted over a period
of about 1 month -- which grants you some time to notice if you accidentally
deleted the wrong VM. The VM's record will be shown in queries until a few days
after its deadline.

Additionally you can pass the field ``deadline`` with an ISO date:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> server.apply([
    ...     {'__type__': 'virtualmachine',
    ...      '__action__': 'delete',
    ...      'deadline': '2020-01-01',
    ...      'name': 'services10'}])

.. note::

    Deletions must be scheduled in the future. The earliest possible
    day is always "tomorrow". Our timezone is Europe/Berlin for this.

To cancel a pending VM deletion you can simply update the VM without giving
any additional data:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> server.apply([{'__type__': 'virtualmachine', 'name': 'services10'}])


Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~

The API allows querying maintenance windows and activities that have been
scheduled for your services. Maintenance windows can not be changed
through the API.

General parameters for maintenance windows can be configured on the
corresponding project object.

A maintenance record looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    {'__type__': 'maintenance',
     'active': True,
     'activities': [{'comment': 'test',
                     'duration': 0,
                     'ended': False,
                     'estimated': 100,
                     'reference_id': '',
                     'result': '',
                     'starts': '2011-07-02T20:00:00+00:00'}],
     'announced': False,
     'comment': '',
     'ends': '2011-07-03T03:00:00+00:00',
     'machine': 'kyle10',
     'starts': '2011-07-02T20:00:00+00:00'}

Times are given in UTC.

Consumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API allows querying consumptions. Consumptions are used to account for
things that you as a customer use or "consume" on our platform. At the
end of a month, those consumptions are reviewed and turned into invoice items.

Consumptions can be queried during a month to see the ongoing view of
your traffic, virtual machines, contracts, and more. Consumptions are also
historic data and remain available even if you delete a project, a VM,
or pass your resources over to a different customer.

Access to consumptions is granted based on the customer of the resource
group that your API key is registered for.

A consumption record looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    {'__type__': 'consumption',
     'customer_no': '12345',
     'parameters': {'traffic': 12345678104378L},
     'period': '2015-01-01',
     'type': 'traffic',
     'type_id': 'myrg'}

The content of `type_id` depends on the type. For example: traffic is
accounted per project. Virtual machines are accounted per virtual
machine. Parameters vary per type as well.

Invoices
~~~~~~~~

The API allows querying invoices. Invoices are generated on a monthly
basis for each customer based on the corresponding consumptions.

Invoices are send out by email in PDF format automatically and can be
retrieved in an automatic fashion from the API. However, due to the
complexities of international taxes, we only show pre-tax information
through the API.

An invoice record looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    {'__type__': 'invoice',
         'consumption_end': '2012-01-31',
         'consumption_start': '2012-01-01',
         'customer_no': '12345',
         'items': [{'description': 'test item',
                    'price': '10.0000',
                    'product': 'PRODUCT1234'}],
         'status': 'pending',
         'total': '10.0000'}
