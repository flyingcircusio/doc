Cron
====

NixOS generally uses `systemd` which provides "Timers" as a replacement for
cron. However, for your convenience, regular cron is available on NixOS
machines.

You can edit a user's crontab with the regular commands:

.. code-block:: console

    Edit the current user's crontab interactively
    $ crontab -e

    Show the current user's crontab
    $ crontab -l

    Delete the current user's crontab
    $ crontab -r

    Replace the current crontab with the rules in <file>
    $ crontab <file>

.. note:: User crontabs are not managed within the NixOS
    configuration model: there is no versioning and no atomic loading.
    Use systemd timers instead, if you can.
