.. _nginx:

nginx
-----

Interaction
^^^^^^^^^^^

Service users may invoke :command:`sudo /etc/init.d/nginx {reload,restart}` to
activate updated nginx configurations.


Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtual hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We provide a basic nginx configuration, but do not define virtual hosts. Service
users may create individual config files in :file:`/etc/nginx/local` that will
be included in a `http` context.

The file :file:`/etc/nginx/local/example-configuration` may serve as a start.
Copy this file to something like :file:`/etc/nginx/local/{vhost}.conf`
and edit it. You must at least:

* replace *www.example.com* with the action virtual host name
* adapt the proxy statements to match your application.

Anonymization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) in nginx log files to be anonymized,
use the log format "anonymized" by adding the following line inside your
*server* declaration block::

   access_log /var/log/nginx/${server_name}_access.log anonymized;

This way, only a /24 prefix for IPv4 addresses and a /48 prefix for IPv6
addresses will be logged.

nginx' error log in :file:`/var/log/nginx/error.log` can not be anonymized this
way. You can, however, modify it's log level (or turn off the error log
completely) by overriding the `error_log
<http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#error_log>`_ directive
`outside` your server declaration block.


Performance logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the normal access log files found in
:file:`/var/log/nginx/{site}.access_log` (common log format), nginx logs
performance data for each request. There is a single log file
:file:`/var/log/nginx/performance.log` which has lines consisting of the
following fields:

- request time in ISO 8601 format
- request identifier (see :ref:`nginx-req-id` below)
- HTTP method
- full URL in the form "SCHEME://HOST/URI*"
- request status
- length (bytes) of the response sent to the client
- length (bytes) of the request received from the client
- **p** if the request was pipelined, **-** otherwise
- total request time (from receiving the first byte until sending the
  last byte)
- comma-separated list of upstream request processing times (several items may
  be logged in case of upstream retries)
- mod_gzip compression ratio or **-** if no compression took place.

Example log line::

  2015-04-17T16:56:36+02:00 32990.1 GET "http://flyingcircus.io/@@/gocept.flyingcircus/js/jquery.min.js" 200 38667 922 . 0.8 "0.002, 0.006" 2.44

Example `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ data import:

.. code-block:: python

   import pandas
   performance = pandas.read_csv(
     'performance.log', sep=' ', quotechar='"', parse_dates=['timestamp'],
     na_values='-', names=('timestamp', 'id',
       'method', 'url', 'status', 'response_length', 'request_length', 'pipe',
       'request_time', 'upstream_times', 'gzip_ratio'))

Example `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_ data import::

   CREATE TABLE performance (
     timestamp          TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
     id                 VARCHAR(24),
     method             VARCHAR(10),
     url                TEXT,
     status             INT,
     response_length    INT,
     request_length     INT,
     pipe               CHAR(1),
     request_time       FLOAT,
     upstream_times     TEXT,
     gzip_ratio         FLOAT
   );

   COPY performance FROM 'performance.log' (FORMAT CSV, DELIMITER ' ',
      QUOTE '"', NULL '-');


.. _nginx-req-id:

Request IDs
^^^^^^^^^^^

`nginx` assigns each HTTP request a unique id. In the default configuration,
the id gets logged to `performance.log` and passed to upstream servers in
the `X-Nginx-Id` request header.

See :file:`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` for details. Users who configure their own
`proxy_set_header` directives should be aware that they have to set this header
on their own if needed.

.. note::

   Request ids are not guaranteed to be unique forever. It is reasonable to
   assume that request ids will not repeat on the same host on the same day.


Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^

- By default, the presence of nginx processes is checked.
- To get checks for individual web pages (presence, specific content, response
  time), please notify the support.


Testing
^^^^^^^

To test your settings, e.g. to ensure you did not introduce some syntax error,
you can use :command:`sudo /etc/init.d/nginx configtest`.


.. _modsecurity:

mod_security
------------

The open-source web application firewall `mod_security
<http://modsecurity.org/>`_ is included on all web gateways. In the default
configuration, however, it is inactive.


Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To activate `mod_security`, enable it in a nginx configuration section
(e.g., `server` or `location`)::

   ModSecurityEnabled on;
   ModSecurityConfig /etc/nginx/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf;

This system-wide configuration file contains some useful defaults like
activating the base rule set etc. Initially, `mod_security` runs in report-only
mode. Additional configuration like switching to policing mode or including
custom rule sets goes into :file:`/etc/nginx/modsecurity/local.conf`. Service
users can also put completely different mod_security configuration files into
the :file:`/etc/nginx/modsecurity` directory and use these in place of the
default configuration file.


Log files
^^^^^^^^^

All `mod_security` events are logged into a directory hierarchy under
:file:`/var/log/nginx/modsec_audit`. Each event is written to a new file.

Log directories which are more than a day old are archived as tarballs under
:file:`/var/log/nginx/modsec_audit_{DATE}.tar.xz` and are subject to normal log
retention.


.. _awstats:

AWStats
-------

The system generates awstats configuration files automatically for every vhost
configured in nginx. awstats configuration generally goes into
:file:`/etc/awstats/vhosts.d` and individual configuration files follow the
naming convention :file:`awstats.{VHOST}.conf`.

awstats configuration for individual vhosts can be augmented with custom
configuration. Just put it into :file:`/etc/awstats/vhosts.d/local.{VHOST}.conf`
and it will be picked up during the next awstats run.

Application deployments may install configuration files for additional vhosts or
replace the system-generated awstats configuration altogether. To do this,
remove the system-generated configuration files (which belong to the `awstats`
user) and replace them with files owned by an service user. Such files will not
be touched by the automatic configuration update.

Web statistics generated on a VM can be accessed through
the `My Flying Circus <https://my.flyingcircus.io>`_ dashboard.

By default, a list of all configured vhosts is presented. The presentation can
be adjusted by creating :file:`/etc/awstats/pages.cfg`. See the comments in
:file:`/srv/www/localhost/cgi-bin/stats.cgi` for details.
