Release 2016_018 (2016-06-09)
-----------------------------

Impact
^^^^^^

* nginx will be restarted.


NixOS platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Patch nginx for CVE-2016-4450. (#21775)

* Fix bug in automatic VM memory adjustments that caused an infinite
  reboot loop. (#21724)

* Implement transit mode (details see below).

Gentoo platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Update backy: reduce partial backup verifications to a time-based limit to
  avoid extremely long periods that block other backups. The verification is
  an additional safety-belt to other data protection schemes, like BTRFS
  scrubbing. (#21879)

* Implement transit mode: physical and virtual machines can be placed in a
  location-independent non-servicing state where the network configuration is
  based on DHCP so that the machine is manageable from either location and
  can be cleanly relocated.

* Security update for gnupg `GLSA 201606-04
  <https://glsa.gentoo.org/glsa/201606-04>`_ (#21829).

* Security update for nginx (no GLSA yet, #21775, CVE-2016-4450)

* Security update for pam  to 1.2.1 `GLSA 201606-05
  <https://glsa.gentoo.org/glsa/201606-05>`_ (#21753).
