.. XXX update on release :Publish Date: YYYY-MM-DD

Release 2017_019 (unreleased)
-----------------------------

Impact
^^^^^^

* [NixOS] Many services will be restarted due to packaging changes, e.g.
  PostgreSQL, nginx, ...

NixOS platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Don't cancel MongoDB startup too eagerly, since it can take a long time for
  journal initialization (#28239).
* Fix LibreOffice build (#28259).
* PostgreSQL: monitor every single listening port to ensure we notice
  inconsistent states after restarts (#28247).
* Ensure correct networking dependencies for PostgreSQL during restarts
  (#28242).
* Fix general metrics collection via Telegraf on VMs with Elasticsearch.
* Automatically restart Grafana when it crashes (#28290).
* Update telegraf to 1.3.1. This new version should fix a bug where the output
  port was closed without reason. Disable the Elasticsearch plugin since it
  gives garbage output (#28044, #28267).
* Update yarn to 0.27.5 (#27873).
* Do not reload nginx workers during logrotate.
* Reload nginx when the configuration changes instead of restart (#28325).
* Improved Nix store references scanning. The scanner is now enabled by default
  on all non-production systems (#27553).


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Setting of ``environment_class`` and ``environment`` in customer api.
