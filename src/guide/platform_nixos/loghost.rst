Nginx
~~~~~

One instance (:ref:`srv interface <logical_networks>`, port TCP 9000) passes logins via `My Flying Circus <https://my.flyingcircus.io>`_ to the web interface of Graylog.

The other (:ref:`srv interface <logical_networks>`, port TCP 9002) is meant for VMs in the same project to access the Graylog API directly.

Graylog
~~~~~~~

Graylog saves user configs and settings in a MongoDB, while ingested messages are stored in :ref:`Elasticsearch <nixos-elasticsearch>`.



Interaction
-------------

Activating the role in a project, activates the "Logs â€¦" button on the `dashboard <https://my.flyingcircus.io>`_. From there on you will be transferred to Graylog's dashboard. Doing that for the first time, a user with adminstrator rights and your current login name will be created.

Alternatively, the URL to access the graylog dashboard directly is: ``http://my.flyingcircus.io/tools/<machine>/graylog/``


API
~~~
Graylog implements its web interface as a first consumer of its REST api. One can also access it directly via

``http://my.flyingcircus.io/tools/<machine>/graylog/api``
``http://my.flyingcircus.io/tools/<machine>/graylog/api/api-browser`` (live documentation)

There is an ``admin`` user setup, which password is to be found in :file:`/etc/local/graylog/password`.

Inputs
------

The following inputs are active by default:

* Syslog UDP on port 5140
