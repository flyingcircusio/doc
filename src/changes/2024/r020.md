# Release 2024_020 (2024-07-01)

## Impact

- \[NixOS 23.11\] Machines will reboot after the update to activate the
   changed kernel.

## NixOS 23.11 platform

- Pull upstream NixOS changes, security fixes and package updates (PL-132741):
  - chromedriver: 125.0.6422.141 -> 126.0.6478.61
  - chromium: 125.0.6422.141 -> 126.0.6478.61
  - firefox: 127.0 -> 127.0.1
  - gitlab: 16.10.7 -> 16.11.5
  - linux_5_15: 5.15.160 -> 5.15.161
  - matrix-synapse: 1.108.0 -> 1.109.0
- **mailserver**: mailservers were running with an implicit local resolver (knot resolver,
  kresd) that was not properly configured and caused issues for customers.
  Our platform provides well-configured resolvers that should be used instead.
  (FC-38677).
- **k3s**: the k3s-server role now includes a Sensu check which checks for pods
  which have been stuck in the "Pending" state for more than 10 minutes
  (PL-132666).
