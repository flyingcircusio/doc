"The NFS server is set up to run in sync mode, so any system call that "
"writes data to files on the NFS share causes that data to be flushed to "
"the server before the system call returns control to user space. This "
"provides greater data cache coherence among clients, but at a significant"
" performance cost."

"The NFS server stores its data at :file:`/srv/nfs/shared`. This directory"

"directly access this directory if there is no special need to do so, but "
"to also use the NFS client component on the server VM."
