=======================

All hardware we procure for our infrastructure will comply to the following
specifications. Older hardware may have been bought adhering to former
versions of the specification and will be upgraded over time and as necessary.

Housing customers' equipment also needs to comply to the specification valid
at the time of installation.

Servers
-------

All servers, independently of their role, require:

* 2 10 GE copper network ports, onboard, shared IPMI port (Intel)
* OS disks: 2 SSDs (internal or rear side)

* BMC supporting IPMI 2.0 with serial console via LAN on shared port
* Redundant power supply
* Sliding rack rails
* Support contract for at least 5 years (next business day, parts
  included)
* Bootable, built-in rescue system

Historic requirements, usually always given nowadways:

* Needs to be bootable from USB flash drive
* PCIe bus
