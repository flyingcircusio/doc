"Prevent *fc-collect-garbage* and system rebuilds by *fc-manage* from "
"running at the same time which caused Nix store corruption breaking *fc-"

"As a side effect of the changes, *service* and *sudo-srv* users can now "
"run {command}`sudo fc-collect-garbage` to clean up unneeded paths from "
"the Nix store with full speed, in contrast to the *fc-collection-"
"garbage.service* which runs throttled and may take a long time. This is "
"helpful for situations when disk space is critically low."

"The garbage collector now keeps build-only Nix dependencies until the "
"dependent packages are collected which also helps to reduce the risk of "
"Nix store corruption and also reduces IO stress."

"We have seen issues with files missing from the Nix store that are still "
"expected to be there, breaking fc-manage until the corruption is fixed "
"manually. We have also seen a Nix store path that got garbage-collected "
"partially in one case. These are probably problems in Nix which have to "
"be addressed upstream but our changes are expected to prevent that in the"
" meantime (#PL-131232)."
