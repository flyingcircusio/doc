# Release 2016_032 (2016-10-18)

## Impact

- VMs now have a limited number of IOPS for their disk operations to ensure
  uniform performance during times of high load. See our blog post
  ["Introducing IO limits to achieve more uniform virtual disk performance"](https://blog.flyingcircus.io/2016/10/13/introducing-io-limits-to-achieve-more-uniform-virtual-disk-performance/) for details.
- All services using OpenSSL need to be restarted.

## Gentoo platform

- Security update for OpenSSL (CVE-2016-2107; #24174).
- Cap IOPS rate for individual VMs according to policy (see above; #22936).
- Fix race conditions in VM migration orchestration (#23729).
- Improve backy monitoring (#23738).
- Fix VM restore bug on backy servers (#23311).
