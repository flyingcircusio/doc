User Profiles
=============

Each home directory has a so-called **user profile**, which allows to have
separate packages and versions compared to the OS. User profiles are thus a
powerful mechanism to tailor an application's runtime environment to the exact
needs of the deployment.

A user profile consists of a directory tree in :file:`~/.nix-profile`,
consisting of the usual subdirectories like *bin*, *include*, *lib*, etc.

Using non-standard base OS packages
-----------------------------------

Packages which are present in the standard nixpkgs distribution but not
installed system-wide can be installed in the user profile with
:command:`nix-env`. See https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html for a list of
available packages.

Example: Installing libjpeg-turbo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider an application needs to compile against `libjpeg-turbo`. Installing the
package via :command:`nix-env -i` makes shared libraries and include files
available in :file:`~/.nix-profile`::

   $ nix-env -i -A nixos.libjpeg
   $ ls ~/.nix-profile/lib
   jpeglib.h
   [...]
   $ ls ~/.nix-profile/include
   libjpeg.la  libjpeg.so.62 libjpeg.so  libjpeg.so.62.2.0
   [...]

You can only install versions provided via the base OS using this method.
However, packages installed using this approach can pick up security updates
quite easily with :command:`nix-env -u`. See :ref:`changelog` for information of
security updates provided by the Flying Circus support team.

See :manpage:`nix-env(1)` for further options.


Custom user environments
------------------------

If more control needs to be excercised on a user profile, we recommend building
a custom environment with `userEnv`. This means that packages from arbitrary
sources can be mixed and pinned to specific versions. In addition, own Nix
expressions can be included.

Basic userEnv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. highlight:: default
   :linenothreshold: 3

Create a file like :file:`userenv.nix` which bundles required packages::

   let
     # pinned import, see https://nixos.org/channels
     nixos_18_03 = fetchTarball https://releases.nixos.org/nixos/18.03/nixos-18.03.132915.d6c6c7fcec6/nixexprs.tar.xz;
     pkgs = import nixos_18_03 {};
   in
   pkgs.buildEnv {
     name = "myproject-env";
     paths = with pkgs; [
       ffmpeg
       nodejs-8_x
       electron
     ];
     extraOutputsToInstall = [ "out" "dev" "bin" "man" ];
   }

The code shown above defines a userEnv with 3 packages installed from a specific
build of NixOS 18.03.

Dry-run this expression with::

   nix-build userenv.nix

A :file:`result` symlink now points to the generated environment. It can be
inspected and used manually, but is not yet an active part of the user profile.

Run ::

   nix-env -i -f userenv.nix

to install this userEnv in your profile. Now its binaries are available in PATH
and libraries/include files should get found by the compiler.

XXX list env vars

To update a userEnv, simply update the source and install it again via
`nix-env`.
