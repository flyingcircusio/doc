-----------------------------

NixOS platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Update Firefox to 56.0.2.
* Decrease Grafana's log-level to *info*.
* Stathost: Allow job-specific relabel configuration.
* `fc-manage --build` now preserves the old release if there is a scheduled
  roll-out of a new release present (#29160).
* Graylog: Use a sensible HAProxy queue timeout (30s) for the Graylog UI and
  API.
* Increase channel update interval to once every 2h for reduced storage load
  during roll-outs (#29353).


Gentoo platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Improved calculation and measurement for Qemu memory overhead. This is
  expected to reduce future VM host crashes significantly (#28840).
