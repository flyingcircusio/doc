.. XXX update on release :Publish Date: YYYY-MM-DD

Release 2017_021 (unreleased)
-----------------------------

Impact
^^^^^^

* Qemu/KVM servers will require maintenance slots to update their network
  configuration. We will let them perform this slowly to monitor the new
  live migration code in production.

NixOS platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Update osrm-backend tp 4.5.0, and update osm2pgsql to 0.92.1 (#28514).


Gentoo platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Multiple storage (Ceph), network and general system performance
  optimizations to reduce load during recovery and maintenance phases.

  Those were pre-released to our storages a few weeks ago already and are
  now included in the stable release branch.

  #27608

* Upgraded storage servers' Linux kernel from 4.9.33 to 4.9.43 in an
  attempt to fix IOMMU issue. (This didn't help unfortunately but downgrading
  isn't needed. We're disabling the IOMMU on storage servers through an
  updated BIOS setting now.)

* Major fc.qemu release that massively improves live migration performance and
  stability (#26784).

* Increase fc.qemu snapshot timeout to prevent unnecessary backup failures
  (#27832).

* Preload NBD kernel module on physical servers for easy restore (#27681).

* Update backy to release 2.2.

* Fix gcc qcheck symlinks.

* Expunge various older puppet utilities.
