Platform: NixOS 19.03
=====================

Our third-generation platform is based upon `NixOS 19.03 <http://nixos.org/>`_.

NixOS provides new approaches for installing and managing software. Also,
VMs on our NixOS platform are run in 64-bit and thus allow you to use much
more memory for larger applications.
