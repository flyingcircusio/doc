# Release 2025_017 (2025-06-02)

## Impact

### 24.11

- Machines will reboot to activate the changed kernel.

- Telegraf will be restarted.

- The Redis cache of GitLab will be flushed.

- GitLab will be restarted.

- Gitlab hosts using `generateSecrets = false;` need to manually generate an ActiveRecord secret.

- GitLab hosts managed by the Flying Circus stay pinned on the previous platform release
  - no customer intervention necessary
  - there is a known regression in this release affecting Gitlab hosts deployed by the Flying Circus
  - to avoid breakage and allow time for fixing, these machines are not upgraded automatically


## NixOS 24.11 platform

- Additional Redis servers configured with `services.redis.servers` now
  get Sensu checks and their metrics are scraped by Telegraf.

  This is not possible if a server doesn't have a TCP listener and its UNIX socket isn't
  readable & writable by its owning group. For each server like that, a warning
  will be printed.

- The option `services.telegraf.environmentVariablesFromFile` was introduced which allows
  substituting variables inside the Telegraf config with the content of a file.

- fix some configuration options for the loki role (PL-133581)

- Fix fs-check script by restoring old use of fc-directory cli (PL-133676)

- The GitLab role requires an active Redis role on the same machine.

- gitlab: generate ActiveRecord encryption secrets

- agent: fix accidental immediate reboots on machines that use specialisations. (PL-133685)

- Removed a PHP test which checked for an issue that has been resolved for some time now (PL-133352)
