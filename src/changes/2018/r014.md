# Release 2018_014 (2018-05-24)

## Impact

- \[NixOS\] Service restarts: PostgreSQL, haproxy, ClamAV, Kibana, Telegraf and
  possibly others.

## NixOS platform

- Reduce VM crash probability on storage hangs (#101499).
- Revamp internal VM console logging to get more relevant data on VM crashes
  (#101499).
- Skip re-activating unchanged configurations in `fc-manage`.
- Improve network dependencies and ordering during boot phase: more robust
  firewall setup with respect to DNS usage and delayed startup of network-based
  services.
- Correctly restart PostgreSQL if the ethsrv interfaces are reconfigured to
  ensure PostgreSQL reopens any lost listening sockets.

## Gentoo platform

- Greatly improve live migration stability and speed up VM host evacuation
  (#100562).
