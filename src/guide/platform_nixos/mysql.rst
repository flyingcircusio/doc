MySQL (Percona)
===============

Managed instance of the `Percona MySQL <http://percona.com>`_ database server.

Components
----------

* MySQL server
* Basic database set up with initial root user creation.

Configuration
-------------

Service users may drop config file snippets containing additional options
into :file:`/etc/local/mysql/*.cnf`.

The password for MySQL's root user can be found in
:file:`/etc/local/mysql/mysql.passwd`. This file is readable by service users.

.. note::

   Please note that there is no default permission that allows root logins from
   external networks. When connecting to MySQL as root, please omit the
   :command:`-h` switch::

      test@test00 ~ $ mysql -u root -p<root password here>


Interaction
-----------

Service users may invoke :command:`sudo fc-manage --build` to apply
service configuration changes and trigger service restarts (if necessary).

Monitoring
----------

The default monitoring setup checks that the MySQL server
process is running.
