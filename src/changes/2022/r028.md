# Release 2022_028 (2022-11-14)

- Note that two vulnerabilities affecting **sudo**
  (CVE-2022-43995) and **sqlite** (CVE-2022-35737) **on all platforms** have
  been published. Fixes are available for platform versions starting with
  21.05. Older platform versions will not be patched anymore. For 22.05, the
  fixes have been already rolled out with earlier releases.

  Even if we don't expect them to have an immediate security impact as they
  require local access or massive amounts of data passed to a C API in the
  sqlite case, we still recommend updating as soon as possible. Please
  upgrade to our current platform version 22.05 or at least 21.05, which is
  the oldest patched version.

  If you have pinned *nixpkgs* in your deployments/environments, as described
  in {external+platform-current:ref}`nixos-user-package-management`, please
  update these as well, also to include the fix for OpenSSL 3 from the
  previous 22.05 release.

## Impact

- \[NixOS 22.05\] Matomo will be restarted.
- \[NixOS 21.11\] Most services will restart because of a core dependency change.
- \[NixOS 21.05\] Most services will restart because of a core dependency change.
