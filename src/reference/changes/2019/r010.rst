Release 2019_010 (2019-04-15)
-----------------------------

Impact
^^^^^^

* Nearly all services will be restarted due to the widespread dependency on
  `gettext`. Expect short service interruptions and performance degradations
  during the roll-out.


NixOS platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fix Docker compatibility of our disk check. Running a container caused the
  disk check to fail due to missing permissions (#107512).
* Security update for `gettext` (#107624).
* Don't run garbage collection in the Nix store shortly after system rebuild.
