User accounts
=============

Principles
----------

* Users are either humans or non-human users for services.
* All users of a project are configured (e.g. visible via getent) on all
  hosts of a project.
* The following attributes are globally unique: username, UID, group
  name, GID.
* The bijections between username/UID and group name/GID are globally unique.
* The presence of an account alone does not imply any permission assignments.

Human users
-----------

* The primary group is `users`.
* The home directory is located in :file:`/home/$USER`.

.. _service_users:

Service users
-------------

* The primary group is `service`.
* The home directory is located in :file:`/srv/$USER`.
* No SSH login is allowed by default to support the general data protection guidelines. In exceptional cases SSH access may be granted.
* human users that have the *sudo-srv* permission in a project are
  allowed to change to the service user (:command:`sudo -u <service_user_name>
  -i`) and execute commands as a service user (:command:`sudo -u
  <service_user_name> <command>`)

.. _permissions:

Permissions
-----------

Users own a separate set of permissions for every project they are a
member of. Common permissions include:

login
   Perform interactive shell login on a machine (via SSH).

manager
  Add or remove other users from the project. Define permissions for users in the project.

sudo-srv
   Sudo into service users on a machine (password not necessary)

stats
   View system statistics (e.g., performance, availability, or web access statistics)


There are more permissions that are not considered critical for general
operations. The full list is documented in :file:`/etc/local/permission.desc`.
