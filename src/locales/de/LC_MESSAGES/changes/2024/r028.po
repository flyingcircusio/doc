"webproxy/varnish: use varnish default work dir and restart varnish on "
"unit file changes. Before, we always reloaded the service which can cause"
" various problems when changes are not picked up. We ran into this "
"problem when the varnish work dir changed in NixOS. To simplify things, "
"we also override the work dir and use the varnish default of "
"`/run/varnishd` instead of symlinking it to a different location. This "
"path is checked by CLI tools like varnishadm, for example. (PL-132901)."
