# Release 2025_025 (2025-07-21)

## General Improvements

We have improved IO throttling on our hypervisors. These performance gains
are available to all running VMs, irrespectively of their platform version:

  * HDD-class VMs can burst from their baseline of 250 IOPS up to 2.500 IOPS for 60 seconds and
    have an explicit bandwidth limit of 250 MiB/s.
  * SSD-class VMs can burst from their baseline of 10000 IOPS up to 20.000 IOPS for 60 seconds
    and have an explicit bandwidth limit of 500 MiB/s.
  * Reads and writes are now throttled separately, so all VMs
    can use their IOPS limit separately for reading and
    writing at the same time.

## Impact

### 25.05

The following services may be restarted: postgresql.service, redis.service


## NixOS 25.05 platform

- devhost: switch to kea as dhcp server (PL-133857)

  We had seen issues with DHCP packets having an invalid checksum. Kea handles this better and seems to resolve provisioning issues.
  We continue to monitor the issues.

- postgresql: add role `postgresql17` for newest major release. All existing versions of the postgresql role remain available.

- Make XFS upgrades at boot-time optional and disable it by default.  (PL-133864)

  We introduced the XFS upgrade code in the 25.05 cycle to allow long-living
  filesystems enable features like "bigtime" which makes the filesystem
  year 2038 compatible. The implementation chose robustness over performance
  but the tradeoff ended up with boot times of tens of minutes even for
  small or medium VMs. We're taking this feature back to the drawing board,
  but provide a knob so it can be used in situations where it's really needed.
