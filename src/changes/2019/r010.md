# Release 2019_010 (2019-04-15)

## Impact

- Nearly all services will be restarted due to the widespread dependency on
  `gettext`. Expect short service interruptions and performance degradations
  during the roll-out.

## NixOS platform

- Fix Docker compatibility of our disk check. Running a container caused the
  disk check to fail due to missing permissions (#107512).
- Security update for `gettext` (#107624).
- Don't run garbage collection in the Nix store shortly after system rebuild.
