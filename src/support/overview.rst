Overview
========

We are happy to assist you with any issues that you may have when using our
services. We have multiple informal ways that you may be communicating with us
like telephone, chat, or video conferences.

However, for situations where a higher due diligence is required (like leaving
a paper trail of what we agreed on) we offer a formal support structure based
on an issue tracking system. You are always welcome to start inquiring about 
any issue through our informal channels - our staff will guide you towards
the more formal structure if needed.

We differentiate inquiries into this system based on whether they critically
affect production services or not.


General Support
---------------

For non-production critical issues please contact our support by sending an 
email to support@flyingcircus.io. This will create a ticket and our staff will
follow up with you within at most a business day.


Emergency Support
-----------------

As a customer with a service level agreement you have access to additional ways
of communication that will ensure that our personnel responds within the agreed
short time frames (i.e. 24/7 and 1h response time) during an emergency.

An emergency is any situation where you experience large visible outages,
are unable to proceed with development, or find yourselve in any other
business-adverse situations caused by or related to our services.

In the case of an emergency we will concentrate our resources towards a
resolution. Other work is postponed until the problem is resolved. Information
about ongoing large scale emergencies and disruptive work is published on our 
`status page <http://status.flyingcircus.io/>`_.

There are three ways for us to get aware of an emergency:

* Our system monitoring detects an outage and alerts us automatically.

* You send an email to emergency+<PIN>@flyingcircus.io (If your PIN is
  `1234`, send an email to `emergency+1234@flyingcircus.io`).

* You call our emergency support number *+49 345 95990625* and enter your
  client-specific PIN.

  The call is forwarded to on-duty supporter who either picks up
  immediately or will call you back within the allowed time frame of the SLA.
  If you phone number is not transmitted, our supporter will follow up with
  known emergency contacts from your team.

In any case there will be a support ticket created automatically.

.. WARNING::

    The standby support is *only* notified during the hours booked
    according to the SLA.

.. NOTE::

    When an emergency ticket is created the active supporters are immediately
    notified via

    * Pushover (https://pushover.net/),

    * Pager (http://www.ecityruf.de/) and

    * Email.
