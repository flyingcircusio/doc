# Firewall

## Concept

We rely mainly on the separation of different VLANs. Firewalls provide
exceptions to the rules. This results in a rather small firewall ruleset which
is easy to understand.

The main decision about access control is expressed by the choice of the
interface(s) application bind to. If an application opens a port on the *fe*
interface, public access is assumed. If an application opens a port on the *srv*
interface, restricted access is assumed.

## Restrictions on the *srv* network

Only few connections from the public internet to ports on the *srv* network
can be opened by default. Machines inside the same project may access the
*srv* ports of their RG peers freely.

Currently we allow public access for:

- SSH (22) - to provide login access to VMs
- NTP (123) - to synchronize clocks with outside hosts
- BGP (179, INPUT routers) to peer with uplink providers
- Domain (53, INPUT on routers) to provide access to selected authoritative zones
- RSYNC (873) - to allow binhosts to provide data to other locations

Managed components that are installed on a machine may provide additional
firewall exceptions (either for public or data center-internal traffic), for
example:

- Grafana (statshost) opens ports 2003 and 2004.
- VxLAN/OpenVPN servers open several ports depending on their configuration.

## Adding custom firewall rules

How to add custom firewall rules depends on the platform of your VM:

- [NixOS 19.03 and newer](/roles/current/firewall.html)
- {ref}`NixOS 15.09 <nixos-firewall>`
